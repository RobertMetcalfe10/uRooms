# uRooms

An app to check what rooms are currently free in UCD.
Every morning it scrapes the updated info from the UCD website on each room which we then use to populate Firebase's realtime database.
Uses Realm for internal storage of favourite rooms.
Also has a QR scanner that can be used on each room to find availability times.
